The process of responding to the form of the user’s device is referred to as (you guessed it) responsive web design (RWD).</div><div><br></div><div>Why is it worth your time to study responsive web design examples and shift your focus to RWD? Some web designers, for example, instead make it their life’s work to ensure a stable user experience across all browsers, often spending days on end addressing small issues with Internet Explorer.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a foolish approach.</div><div><br></div><div>Some web designers spend days on end addressing small issues with Internet Explorer and leave their mobile users as second-hand visitors. This is a foolish approach.</div><div>Mashable called 2013 the year of responsive web design. Why? Over 30% of their traffic comes from mobile devices. They project that this number could reach 50% by the end of the year. Across the web in general, 17.4% of web traffic came from smartphones in 2013. At the same time, Internet Explorer usage, for example, accounts for just 12% of all browser traffic, down about 4% from this time last year (according to W3Schools). If you’re optimizing for a specific browser, rather than the global smartphone population, you’re missing the forest for the trees. And in some cases, this can mean the difference between success and failure—responsive design has implications for conversion rates, SEO, bounce rates, and more.</div><div><br></div><div><h3 blogh3="">The Responsive Web Design Approach</h3> </div><div>What’s commonly glossed over about RWD is that it’s not just about adjusting the appearance of your webpages; instead, the focus should be on logically adapting your site for usage across different devices. For example: using the mouse does not provide the same user experience as, say, the touchscreen. Don’t you agree? Your responsive mobile vs. desktop layouts should reflect these differences.</div><div><br></div><div>At the same time, you don’t want to be completely rewriting your site for each of the tens of different screen sizes on which it might be viewed—such an approach is simply infeasible. Instead, the solution is to implement flexible responsive design elements that use the same HTML code to adjust to the user’s screen size.</div><div><br></div><div>From a technical point of view, the solution lies in this responsive design tutorial: using CSS media queries, pseudo-elements, flexible set grid layouts, and other tools to dynamically adjust to a given resolution.</div><div><br></div><div><h3 blogh3="">Media Queries in Responsive Design</h3> </div><div>Media types first appeared in HTML4 and CSS2.1, which enabled the placement of separate CSS for screen and print. In this way, it was possible to set separate styles for a page’s computer display vis-à-vis its printout.</div><div><br></div></div>
